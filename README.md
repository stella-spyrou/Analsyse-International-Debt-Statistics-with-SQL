# Analsyse International Debt Statistics with SQL

This is a project experimenting with SQL queries in order to answer interesting questions about international debt using data from The World Bank.

In this project, I perform an analysis of international debt data collected by The World Bank. 
The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. 
Specifically, it contains both national and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from 1970 to 2015.

Answers are given to questions like:
• What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
• Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
• What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
